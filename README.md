# AlgoPath

The goal of the application is to create a DSA Tracker to take control of the most popular exercises of LeetCode.

## Learning Paths
A learning path is a path through a set of exercises that you can choose to follow. It will be based on the difficulty of the exercise and the amount of time you have to complete it.

You can find multiple learning paths around web, example:
- Grind75
- Bind75
- NeetCode150
- AlgoExpert

My idea is put that paths in the app, and show the user the progress of the learning path, and the next exercise to do, create a timer and different statistics about the learning path. Maybe create a leaderboard of users and a gamification system.
